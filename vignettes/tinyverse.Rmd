## Introduction

The R community  [`tinyverse`](https://tinyverse.netlify.app/) movement is a tryout of creating a new package development standards. The clue is the TINY part here.
The last years od R package development were full of high number of dependencies temptations.
`tinyverse` means as least dependencies as possible as R package dependencies matter. 
Every dependency you add to your project is an invitation to break your project.

More information is available on [`tinyverse` website](https://www.tinyverse.org/).

## `tinyverse` badges

The `tidyverse` team want to help and motivate R developers. Thus they created a rest-api which generates a dependencies badge for each CRAN package. 
The badge contains 2 numbers the first number is a direct dependencies and the second one recursive ones.
 The R base packages are not counted. The `tinyverse` badge could have 4 colors bright green or green or orange or red, to get a green badge package have to have less than 5 packages (<5) in the `Depends`/`Imports`/`LinkingTo` fields (check Dependencies subsection for more description). 
To have a bright green a zero dependencies are needed. The orange badge is from 5 to 9 dependencies (>=5 and <=9). And the last oen red when there are more than 9 dependencies (>= 10). Of course the base packages are not counted as a dependency, `pacs::pacs_base()`.

Summing up, each badge constraint:

- bright green: 0
- green: <5
- orange (>=5 and <=9)
- red (>= 10)

## tidyverse vs tidyverse

The `tidyverse` is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. 
All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. 
On the other hand the `tinyvere` is only a R community movement which try to make a new programming standard.
There is no `tinyverse` packages collection, any package which have less than 5 direct dependencies (in the `Depends`/`Imports`/`LinkingTo` fields) are treated as a decent one. The best is to have zero dependencies.
Even `tidyverse` looks to go in the direction of `tinyverse` if we check their lower level packages like `purrr`, `forcats`, `renv` or `rlang`.

the core `tidyverse` packages:

## R package Dependencies

TL;DR

- END USER perspective: `install.packages` requires **Depends**/**Imports**/**LinkingTo** DESCRIPTION fields dependencies, recursively. `pacs::pac_deps_user` could be used to get them.
- DEVELOPER perspective: `R CMD check` requires **Depends**/**Imports**/**LinkingTo**/**Suggests** DESCRIPTION fields dependencies, and for them **Depends**/**Imports**/**LinkingTo** fields recursively. `pacs::pac_deps_dev` could be used to get them.

Now you might think of what preciously these R package dependencies mean.
The R DESCRIPTION file is the place where we could explore the number and nature of dependencies, the 5 fields are representing different types of dependencies: **Depends**/**Imports**/**LinkingTo**/**Suggests**/**Enhances**.

DESCRIPTION file dependencies:

```
Package: NAME
...
Depends: 
  R (>= 3.6)
Imports:
  dplyr
  data.table
LinkingTo:
  Rcpp
Suggests:
  testthat
  ca2cat
Enhances:
  Hmisc
...
```

We could get any installed packages description file with the `packageDescription` function. 
More than that the `pacs::pac_description` could get any even not installed package description file and for any version you want.

`packageDescription("pacs")`

When we run `install.packages` (and other install functions like `remotes::install_github`) only 3 fields are installed **Depends**/**Imports**/**LinkingTo**.
We could easily confirm that by checking its help page and the `dependencies` argument definition:

```
?install.packages
...
dependencies: 
 ...
 The default, ‘NA’, 
 means ‘c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo")’.
```

**Depends** are packages `library` (attached), before the main package is `library` (attached). 
So when we `library()` the main package **Depends** dependencies functions are available to the end user in the R console.
This could be more convenient for the end user if the main package is for example offering additional functionality over the dependency one.

The **Imports** field lists packages whose namespaces are imported from (as specified in the NAMESPACE file or when sb is using `::`/`:::` inside the package) but which do not need to be attached (`library`). So when we `library()` the main package such dependencies functions are not available to the user in the R console.
Namespaces accessed by the `::` and `:::` operators (e.g. `ggplot2::ggplot`) must be listed in the **Imports** field, or in **Suggests** (when used only for tests or examples). 

A package that wishes to make use of header files in other packages to compile its C/C++ code needs to declare them as a comma-separated list in the field **LinkingTo**.
Specifying a package in **LinkingTo** suffices if these are C/C++ headers containing source code or static linking is done at installation: the packages do not need to be (and usually should not be) listed in the **Depends** or **Imports** fields.

So what about the rest. **Suggests** are installed when we run `R CMD CHECK` (or higher level like `devtools::check()`), they are used for tests (e.g. testthat) or for examples (`roxygen2` @examples). **Enhances** is used rarely as these are packages which could extent the usage and are NOT needed for running examples and tests. If your tests/examples use e.g. a dataset from another package it should be in **Suggests** and not **Enhances**.

So now we see that a **Imports** dependency is not equal to a **Suggests** dependency. From the perspective of the end user we focus on **Depends**/**Imports**/**LinkingTo** dependencies which they will downlaod with `install.packages`. 

It’s common for packages to be listed in Imports in DESCRIPTION, but not in NAMESPACE.
The DESCRIPTION file Imports field really has nothing to do with functions imported into the namespace. 
The DESCRIPTION file Imports is mainly used by `install.packages`. 
On the other hand NAMESPACE is a place where we defining what we need to build our package and what we want to expose to the end users (export). Nowadays the NAMESPACE file is even more mistearious as it is build automatically e.g. by `roxygen2` package.
A package have to be listed in the **Imports** in DESCRIPTION file, but not in NAMESPACE if we will call the dependencies function with `::` in the main package. This explicit calls to dependencies are preferred.

## `tinytest` vs `testthat`

This subsection will be a subjective view on the difference between `tinytest` and `testthat` packages.
This is a great example in my opinion as showing that package could have many dependencies nevertheless not exposed to the end user (these dependencies are not installed with `install.packages`), as is in `Suggests` field of the DESCRIPTION file.
`tinytest` was created to offer similar functionality to `testthat` package nevertheless `tinytest` has zero dependencies.
For me `tinytest` is an interesting alternative compared to `testthat` nevertheless not so obvious replacement.
I do not care how many dependencies has the `testthat` package as it is located in `Suggests` field of DESCRIPTION file. `testthat` will not be delayed loaded with `requireNampese` too.
This mean that the higher number of dependencies from the `testthat` package is only my problem (developer one, not the end user) when e.g. I am checking the package (e.g. with `R CMD check`).
To be fair how many additional packages have to be downloaded by **a developer** (e.g. for `R CMD check`) when comparing `tinytest` and `testthat`. When we want to check these packages directly, I will be adding some code to these packages. In the case of `tinytest` it is zero packages and for `testthat` 80 packages now. Please use `pacs::pac_deps_dev("tinytest")` and `pacs::pac_deps_dev("testthat")` calls to confirm that.
When `tinytest` and `testthat`are in the Suggests field of another package (e.g. `pacs`) which we will be `R CMD check`, then developer need additional 0 packages for `tinytest` and 30 packages for `testthat` (`pacs::pac_deps_user("testthat")`). Remember that these dependencies might overlap with other packages and their dependencies.

Dependencies from the end user perspective:

`testthat`:  
[![](https://tinyverse.netlify.com/badge/testthat)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=testthat)

## How to reduce the number of dependencies

One of the method of reducing number of dependencies (exposed to end users) is to transfer the package from Imports to Suggests and load it in the delayed manner, or not include it at all. 
So we have to identify package functions which will be used optionally or rarely (are not a core of the package).
Then we have to apply conditional execution of it if the package is installed (available), if not then ask user to install it.
If a function with such delayed loaded package is used in examples or tests then the package have to be in **Suggests** field.

```
func <- function() {
  if (requireNamespace("PACKAGE", quietly = TRUE)) {
    # regular code 
  } else {
    stop("Please install the PACKAGE to use the func function")
  }
}
```

`parsnip`:

`caret`:  
[![](https://tinyverse.netlify.com/badge/testthat)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=testthat)

`parsnip` and `caret` packages are examples which apply this strategy.
It could be easily confirmed by looking for `requireNamespace` phrase with github search, from each of the repo.

## `pacs` package

One of the functionality of the `pacs` package is to check a package complexity. We could check the number of dependencies (recursively or not) and even check how many MB are allocated for a package and all its dependencies.

**Weight Case Study: `devtools`**

Take into account that packages sizes are appropriate for your local system (`Sys.info()`).
Installation with `install.packages` and some `devtools` functions might result in different packages sizes.

If you do not want to install anything in your current library (`.libPaths()`) and still inspect a package size, then a usage of the `withr` package is recommended. `withr::with_temp_libpaths` is recommended to isolate the download process.

```r
# restart of R session could be needed
withr::with_temp_libpaths({install.packages("devtools"); cat(pacs::pac_true_size("devtools") / 10**6, "MB", "\n")})
```

Installation in your main library.

```r
# if not have
install.packages("devtools")
```

Size of the `devtools` package:

```r
cat(pacs::pac_size("devtools") / 10**6, "MB", "\n")
```

True size of the package as taking into account its dependencies.
At the time of writing it, it is `113MB` for `devtools` without base packages (`Mac OS arm64`).

```r
cat(pacs::pac_true_size("devtools") / 10**6, "MB", "\n")
```

A reasonable assumption might be to count only dependencies which are not used by any other package.
Then we could use `exclude_joint` argument to limit them.
However hard to assume if your local installation is a reasonable proxy for an average user.

```r
# exclude packages if at least one other package use it too
cat(pacs::pac_true_size("devtools", exclude_joint = 1L) / 10**6, "MB", "\n")
```

It is crucial to check the number of dependencies too:

[![](https://tinyverse.netlify.com/badge/devtools)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=devtools)

```r
# 70 recursive dependencies
pacs::pac_deps("devtools", local = TRUE)$Package
# 20 direct dependencies
pacs::pac_deps("devtools", local = TRUE, recursive = FALSE)$Package
```
